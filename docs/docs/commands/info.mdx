# `/undeadpandemic info`

> **Deprecated** — As of **v3.0.0**, this command is fully replaced by  
> [`/undeadpandemic ?`](help).

The `/undeadpandemic info` command displays detailed information about the plugin, including its version, creator, contributors, and a link to this documentation.

It remains functional for backwards compatibility, but you should update scripts or instructions to use `/undeadpandemic ?` instead.
