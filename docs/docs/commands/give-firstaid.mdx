# `:firstaid` Argument

The `:firstaid` argument is used with the `/undeadpandemic give` command to grant a player first aid items. First aid items are structured and predefined within UndeadPandemic, and cannot be customised beyond visual display options.

---

## How It Works

When typing the command, the **tab-complete menu** will automatically show every available first aid item defined by the plugin. Simply select the one you want to give.

You will also find a **`kit` option**, which gives the player **one of each first aid item**.

> **Note:** First aid items are hardcoded.  
> You cannot add new types, only customise appearance.

See **[First Aid Items](/items/first-aid/kit)** for detailed information on what each item does.
