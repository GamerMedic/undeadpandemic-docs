# 🧟‍♀️ Hordes

Hordes have been implemented as part of the **Blood Moon** event. Hordes will become a standalone feature in the future. Watch this space.

Hordes are the main event whenever a zombie apocalypse happens.

A horde occurs when a player stays in the same area for a while. More and more zombies appear and take over the area, overwhelming the player.

When enough zombies have congregated in the same area, the player will suddenly get a **bad feeling**. This is only the start. Once a horde begins, it causes a surge in **one type of zombie**.

The zombie type that increases is chosen **at random**, and how much they increase by depends on the `config.yml` configuration.

> **Note:** Any horde effects only apply to zombies that spawn during a horde. Zombies that existed prior to the start of a horde event are not affected.

## Premium Version Information

Players using the **premium version** of UndeadPandemic will notice something slightly different: the type of zombie that appears more often is influenced by the biome the player is in.

This is not configurable, but some examples are:

- **Slow zombies** appear more often in colder biomes.  
- **Strong zombies** appear more often in harsher biomes such as deserts and swamps.  
- **Fast zombies** appear more often in biomes with very few hiding places, such as deserts, plains, and badlands (mesa).  
- **Stupid zombies** appear more often in areas with a lot of flora, such as mushroom islands and jungles.
