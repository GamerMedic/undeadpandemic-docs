# 🌑 Blood Moon

**[Premium Only]**

There's something special about a full moon, isn't there?

If you ask any member of the emergency services or healthcare sector, they'll tell you that the crazies come out during a full moon.

There's some truth to that—or so it seems anyway. But how does that relate to zombies?

Well, zombies used to be people, and they still go bonkers for a full moon.

So every full moon there's a chance—just a chance, mind you—that the power of the moon will produce a horde not worth fighting. Your best defence? **Hide.** Or at least get a **Gatling Gun**.

And once the hordes start, they don't stop until the full moon disappears.

**Our advice:** Make sure you have a productive farm and strong walls.
