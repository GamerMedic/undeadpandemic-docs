# 🧟‍♂️ Zombies

Everything you need to know about zombies in **UndeadPandemic**.  

The plugin allows you to add an **unlimited number of zombie types**.  

You can **enable or disable** zombie types in `config.yml`.  
If all custom zombies are disabled, the plugin will default to using **vanilla Minecraft zombies**.

---

## Creating a New Zombie Type

To create a new type of zombie:

1. Open `config.yml`  
2. Add the configuration settings for your new zombie type  

Example zombie types include:

- **Strong Zombie**  
- **Stupid Zombie**

Be creative—but balance challenge and fun to avoid overpowered zombie mutants. You can even equip zombies with armour!

## 🧟‍♀️ Hordes

Hordes occur when large numbers of zombies spawn together in an area.  

- Currently, hordes rely on **spawn rates** and are **not directly controllable**.  
- In **v2.7.0**, hordes will be **more orchestrated** and will aggressively attack players.  
- Zombie types in hordes will spawn based on the **odds defined in `config.yml`**.  

Hordes in future versions:

- Can be timed or triggered at random  
- Players with the right permissions can start a horde using a new command  
- Will officially become a dedicated **Event** in v2.7.15

## ☣️ Zombie Infections

Zombies have a chance of **infecting players**:

- Minor infections can be cured using **antibiotics**  
- Untreated infections will **slowly damage or kill** the player  

---

## 🔢 Zombie Attributes

Since **v2.5.0**, zombies are almost entirely **customisable**:

- Adjust **strength, speed, intelligence, and behaviour**  
- Equip zombies with **armor or special abilities**  
- Balance is key—ensure zombies are challenging but not overpowered  

---

## Future Version Changes

- Zombie spawns will eventually be **influenced by biomes**, adding further variety to gameplay.
