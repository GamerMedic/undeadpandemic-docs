# ☣️ Zombie Infections

Players can become infected in the following ways:

- When **attacked by a zombie**  
- When **eating Rotten Flesh**

The chance of infection is set in `config.yml` (default: **40%**).

### Symptoms of Infection

By default, an infected player will experience:

- **Poisoned**  
- **Pain**  
- **Lethargy**  
- **Increased appetite**  
- **Weakness**  
- **Confusion**  

> These symptoms are configurable in `config.yml`. If no symptoms are defined, the defaults above will apply.

Symptoms last for **2 minutes by default**, but this duration can also be configured.

---

### Effects

- **Pain** will cause **harm over time**, potentially killing the player if untreated.  
- By default, infections **cannot be cured with milk** (unlike vanilla Minecraft).  
- Infections **can be cured using antibiotics**, or via settings adjusted in `config.yml`.
