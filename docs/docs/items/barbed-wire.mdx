# 🕸️ Barbed Wire

## Description

Barbed Wire is a defensive item made using the cobweb material.  
Walking through barbed wire **damages and slows** players, making it ideal for securing camps or choke-points.

---

## What Does Barbed Wire Do?

Barbed wire has two core effects:

- **Damages players** who walk through it  
- **Slows movement**, increasing vulnerability to zombies and players  

This makes it a powerful environmental defence tool.

---

## How Is Barbed Wire Obtained?

Barbed wire can currently be obtained in two ways:

- **Via commands**  
- **Via custom crafting recipes** (if configured)

> **Note:**  
> From **v3.0.0**, barbed wire is intended to become a craftable item requiring a specific **name** and **lore** to function correctly. This behaviour may change in future versions.

---

## Modifying Barbed Wire

Barbed wire behaviour can be customised in the `config.yml`:

- **Enable or disable** barbed wire entirely  
- **Change the damage value** players receive when walking through it  

This allows full control over how punishing barbed wire is in your server’s survival environment.
