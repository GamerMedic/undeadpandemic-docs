# 🔋 Batteries

## Description

Batteries allow players to continue using a **Torch** by recharging it.  
This enables torches to last significantly longer and remain reliable in dangerous environments.

---

## What Do Batteries Do?

Batteries can be used to:

- **Recharge a player's torch**
- **Extend torch lifespan**
- Reduce the need for frequent replacements

They are essential for players navigating dark or infected areas.

---

## How Are Batteries Obtained?

Batteries can be obtained through:

- **The `/undeadpandemic give` command**  
  *(This allows server admins full control over battery distribution.)*

- **Crafting (from v3.0.0 onwards)**  
  Batteries become craftable through **custom recipes** that server owners can define.

> In future versions, additional crafting support and recipe improvements will be added.

## Modifying the Battery

You can fully customise battery properties via the `config.yml`:

- **Item name**
- **Lore**
- **Material**
- **Custom model data**

This allows batteries to integrate visually and thematically with any resource pack or gameplay style.
