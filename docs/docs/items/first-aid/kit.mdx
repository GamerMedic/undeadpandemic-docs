## Using First Aid Kits

Using a first aid kit is simple:

1. **Place the kit on the ground.**  
2. The kit will open and **all included first aid items will drop out**.  
3. These items can then be collected and used normally.

### Important Notes

- After opening a first aid kit, the player will **receive the empty chest back**.  
- This is **intentional behaviour** — the empty chest can be reused for storage or decoration.
