# 👑 UndeadPandemic v3.0.0

### **== Re-Release ==**

After a year of work re-building this plugin, it's a pleasure to announce that the following features have been improved or introduced!

> 👑 Don't worry about the premium crown icon up there, this version is **free** with the *option* of upgrading!

## 1. Customisable Zombies

Highly customisable zombies are the core of this apocalyptic plugin. You can configure the following attributes:

- Name
- Health
- Speed
- Strength
- Whether the zombie can break doors
- Full armour
- Weapon

There are **4 types of zombies**:

- Slow
- Strong
- Stupid
- Vanilla

Zombies can drop various items. A few starter items are included, but you can customise what they drop.

## 2. Zombie Guts

Yes! It's back!  

This time, instead of wearing guts as a chestplate, you cover your chest plate in guts. The timer works the same as before, giving you a random amount of time.

**New features:**

1. Guts wash off in rain and water.
2. While invisible to zombies, you move slower than normal.
3. This is a premium feature.

---

## 3. Zombie Kills & Rewards

The core mechanic remains — kill zombies.  

Premium users can choose if zombies die *only* from headshots.  

- Damage multiplier reduces zombie damage intake for added difficulty.
- You can configure rewards (money or items) in `config.yml`.

---

## 4. Animal Drops

Simplified configuration:

- If `animal-drops` is enabled, `drop-chance` determines likelihood of [Rotten Flesh](https://docs.stevezr963.me/items/rotten-flesh) instead of normal meat.
- Drop names and which animals drop rotten flesh are fully customisable.

---

## 5. Thirst System

- Similar to previous versions, with fewer bugs.
- Boss bar can be disabled; use placeholders instead.
- Customisable items count towards thirst.
- Maximum thirst, warning levels, and buffer effects configurable.
- Premium users can adjust dehydration rate; free users have fixed rate.

---

## 6. Tainted Water

- Code optimised for efficiency; mechanics remain the same.
- Chance for collected water to be tainted (“Dirty Water”).
- Boil water in a cauldron over heat sources to purify.
- Default heat sources:
  - Magma Blocks
  - Camp Fires
  - Lava

---

## 7. Custom Items

Deliver medical treatment or use medical supplies:

- **Adrenaline:** Short boost, max health, temporary damage resistance.
- **Analgesia:** Removes pain effects.
- **Antibiotics:** Cures poisonous buffers.
- **Bandages:** Heals injuries via regeneration buffer.
