## Features
- Added custom recipes for:
  - Adrenaline  
  - Analgesia  
  - Antibiotics  
  - Batteries  
  - Torches
- Added **premium feature** allowing cauldrons to be filled by rainwater *(BETA)*.  
  - Cauldrons must be out in the open; will not fill if a block is within 16 blocks above it.  
  - Config option added: `camps.fill-containers-in-rain: true`.
- Updated campfire dousing so it only occurs after rain starts, instead of immediately when the weather changes.  
  - Usual dousing effects are still applied.
- Updated zombie logic to improve door breaking. Iron doors cannot be broken by zombies.
