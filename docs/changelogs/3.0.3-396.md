<!-- truncate -->
- Fixed issue where cauldrons don't fill during rain.
- Improved cauldron detection while raining.
- Made cauldron filling during rain more efficient.
- Fixed zombie kill count so that headshots now count toward total kills.
- Zombie Guts are now applied by dragging and dropping onto a chestplate.
- Added 10 new lines to language files for plate and guts status messages *(manual update may be required)*.
- Updated permission manager for more consistent behaviour.
- Added `disable-drops` setting in the zombies section (prevents zombies from dropping items except Zombie Guts; requested by iOrchid).
- Fixed blacklisting issue allowing zombies to spawn during daytime in blacklisted/non-whitelisted worlds.
- Fixed issue where day-spawning zombies always returned a single zombie type.
- Updated Blood Moon event *(changes are a secret 🤫)*.
- Disabled custom zombie natural spawns due to unresolved issues; custom zombies will still appear during the day.
- Updated campfires to prevent dousing if covered by a block up to 16 blocks above, rather than just directly above.
- Added `camps.campfires` and `camps.cauldrons` sections in the config to make campfires and cauldrons configurable during rain.
- Added `interval` and `delay` options for campfires and cauldrons. *(Only works in premium; rain has no effect in free version.)*  
  - When `delay` is false, updates are instant.  
  - Otherwise, updates occur at the rate defined by `interval`.
- Added `campfires.douse-in-rain` and `cauldrons.fill-in-rain` options.
